:information_source:  

```
User Story Acceptance Criteria
```
```
As a manager, I want to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
so that I have quick access to emails and GitHub profiles:  
WHEN I run the application,
THEN the application will prompt the user for information about the team manager
WHEN I enter the information about the team manager information, 
THEN the application will prompt the user for information about the team members
WHEN the user enter any number of team members
THEN they will be a mix of engineers and interns
WHEN I run the unit tests
THEN they all pass
WHEN the user has completed building the team
THEN the application will create an HTML file that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on the information provided by the user.
```
